Comments on Structure

    Backend Directory:
        All necessary files for your Django backend are in place. Make sure to configure settings.py properly, especially regarding database settings and allowed hosts.
    Finance App:
        This is where you'll define your models and views related to financial data. Consider creating a serializers.py file here in the finance directory when you start working with Django REST Framework.
    Frontend Directory:
        The frontend directory is well-structured with all necessary files created by Create React App. The src folder is where you'll develop your React components.
    Git Directory:
        The presence of the .git directory indicates that you have initialized a Git repository, which is great for version control.
    Project Structure Document:
        Having a project_structure.txt file is a good practice if you want to document your project's organization and any specific conventions you’re following.

Next Steps

    Start Developing Your Backend:
        Define your models in finance/models.py.
        Create serializers in finance/serializers.py.
        Set up views in finance/views.py.
    Run Migrations:
        After defining your models, run migrations to set up the database schema:

        bash
        python manage.py makemigrations finance
        python manage.py migrate

Develop Your Frontend:

    Begin creating components in the src folder of your React app.
    Use mock data or static JSON files to simulate API responses until your backend is ready.

Connect Frontend and Backend:

    Once both sides are developed, you can use Axios or Fetch API to connect your React frontend with the Django API.

Version Control:

    Regularly commit your changes to Git as you develop both the backend and frontend.
